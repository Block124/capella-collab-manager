# Create a _Collab Manager_ project

Collab Manager proposes a wizard to create projects. Any user can create a project (however, only an administrator can
add a Team for Capella source, which is needed to set up a Team for Capella backup.), and the creator will be manager of
the project. To create a project, go to the _Projects_ tab of the navigation bar, and click on _Add new project_.

### General information

This page allows to set a project name and description. Only the name is required.

### Add team members

This page allows to manage the project user. By default, you are manager of the project.

### Add models

This page allows to create a model for the project. See the model creation page for more information.
