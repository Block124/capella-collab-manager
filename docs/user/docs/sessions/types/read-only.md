# Getting started with read-only project access

If you have read-only project access, or you simply want to check the model without risk of editing, you may start a read-only session.

To do so, select the project from the project overview and the model from the project details where you want to start a read-only session, and click on the `eye`-button.

Starting read-only session may take a bit of time, depending on the size of the model and the current load.
After the request, the application will fetch the requested model and change history from git and place it into an empty workspace.
When the loading has finished, you can connect to the session.
