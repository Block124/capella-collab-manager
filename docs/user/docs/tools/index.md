# Tools management

Collab Manager proposing Remote Desktop Protocol server instances and Git synchronisation, it could fit any tool and not
only Capella, provided that there is a Docker image for this tool. Thatâ€™s why Collab Manager provides an interface to
manipulate Tools.

## What is a Tool

A Tool is any software that allows to work on projects. Capella Collab allow to set for a Tool several Versions and
Natures. In the case of Capella, versions are _5.0_, _5.2_, _6.0_, and natures are _model_ and _library_.
The software is given as a Docker image template, with the version as a variable to get a Docker image.

## Managing tools

To manage tools, you have to be Administrator.

The tool management page can be found at Profile > Settings > Core > Tools. It allows to:

 - Change the docker images for
   - the persistent session
   - the read-only session
   - the backup (in the case of Team for Capella only)
 - Set versions and natures

## Using the tools

Once a tool is created, models using this tool can be created. Note that there is no initialization routine for the
models of a tool.
