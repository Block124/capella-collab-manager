# Getting started with read-only project access

If you have a read-only project access, or you simply want to check the model without risk of editing, you may start a read-only session.

To do so, go to the model where you want to start a read-only session, and click on the eye.

Starting read-only session may take a bit of time, depending on the size of the model and depth of change history you requested.

During the start process the application will fetch the requested model and change history (if requested) from git and place it into an empty workspace. Although you can save changed, the read-only workspace is gone as soon as the session is terminated.
